Put all the hidden files in this folder into 
your ~/ folder and then re-launch the terminal

It may also be worthwhile to have all the files in your ~/.bash_files folder
and have ONLY .bash_profile in the root. That way everything is in
a single place that you can manage easier.
To accommodate this, if you have a ~/.bash_files folder, that's where 
.bash_profile will load all the bash aliases and files from.

## Installation

    cd ~/Projects
    git clone git@github.com:cybertoast/system_config.git

    cp -ri system_config/term/.bash_profile ~/
    cp -ri system_config/term/.bash_files ~/
    cp -ri system_config/term/.gitconfig ~/
